Abstract:

Prediction of a default among clients is one of the most common applications
of machine learning models in finance. This paper applies several models.
Among the linear models, logistic regression, LASSO, and Ridge regression
are trained. To capture nonlinear relationships, random forest and XGBoost
are applied. Our dataset consists of 10,000 observations of a target variable in-
dicating whether a client defaulted, along with 8 client features describing their
financial state. Missing values are present, and several imputation techniques
are employed, including k-nearest neighbors, decision trees, logistic regression,
and data generated by normal and lognormal distributions. Among the lin-
ear models, logistic regression displayed the highest AUC (0.9110), followed
by LASSO (0.9108) and Ridge (0.9104). Among the nonlinear models, XG-
Boost (AUC = 0.916) outperforms Random Forest (AUC = 0.906). Notably,
XGBoost outperforms both other nonlinear and linear models. These results
confirm the effectiveness of non-linear machine learning models in banking ap-
plications, particularly when predictive accuracy is critical.
